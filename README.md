A code-along Jupyter notebook for the Flatiron School Meetup, "The Science Behind Netflix Recommendations: Workshop", presented on: 
- June 5, 2019
- October 21, 2019

The dataset used is **The Movies Dataset** found on Kaggle, specifically from the file *ratings_small.csv*: https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset

## Additional Readings and Resources:

I wrote a couple posts on Medium about recommendation engines: https://medium.com/@yishuen
- [A Primer to Recommendation Engines](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-primer-to-recommendation-engines-49bd12ed849f)
- [Collaborative Filtering on Utility Matrices](https://towardsdatascience.com/math-for-data-science-collaborative-filtering-on-utility-matrices-e62fa9badaab)

A great book on recommendation engines. My favorite chapter is Chapter 9, and I highly *recommend* it if you want to understand how SVD works using gradient descent + Alternating Least Squares.

A couple really good podcast episodes that got me started with recommendation engines:
- Data Skeptic: http://dataskeptic.libsyn.com/recommender-systems-live-from-farcon-2017
- Linear Digressions: http://lineardigressions.com/episodes/2017/6/25/factorization-machines
