[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/yishuen/meetup-movie-recommender/master)

A code-along Jupyter notebook for the Flatiron School Meetup, "The Science Behind Netflix Recommendations: Workshop"; June 5, 2019.

The dataset used is The Movies Dataset found on Kaggle, specifically from the file *ratings_small.csv*: https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset

## Additional Readings and Resources:

A great book on recommendation engines. My favorite chapter is Chapter 9, and I highly *recommend* it if you want to understand how SVD works using gradient descent + Alternating Least Squares.

A couple really good podcast episodes that got me started with recommendation engines:
- Data Skeptic: http://dataskeptic.libsyn.com/recommender-systems-live-from-farcon-2017
- Linear Digressions: http://lineardigressions.com/episodes/2017/6/25/factorization-machines
